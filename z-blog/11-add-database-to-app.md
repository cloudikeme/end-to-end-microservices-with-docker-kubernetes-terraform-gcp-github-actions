# how to integrate databases, Redis and Postgresql, with microservices application.

## Introduction


## Why Redis and PostgreSQL

## Adding a database server in development

We are going to add a database to our application in development using
Docker Compose in the same way that we added our video-storage
microservice earlier in this chapter. Now in example-3 we will add one new
container to our Docker Compose file to host a single database server. We
only need a single server, but we can host many databases on that server.
This means weâ€™ll be set up for the future to easily create more databases as
we add more microservices to our application. The layout of example-3 as
you can see in figure 4.15 is mostly the same as example-2, except now we
have the addition of a JSON file that contains some test data that we will add
to our database.

## Database-per-microservice or database-per-application?
