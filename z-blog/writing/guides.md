Do not use "we" and imperative ("Apply the deployment to", "Verify the pods are running", "Now access Dashboard ", etc.) language. Only use "we" language. Ensure you remove all "you" and imperative language.
Reduce the number of links in the article to between 4-7. Prioritize internal links to Baeldung which cover main aspects of the topic.
Replace all â€™ apostrophes with '. Copy the latter to ensure the correct replacement.
Pass the text through a grammar checker like the free version of Grammarly and apply any adequate suggestions.
Remove the last paragraph/sentence of section 1.
Do not start a section immediately with a subsection. Add a brief introduction.
Add periods to the ends of subsection numbers.
Add simple "$ " prompts in front of all commands in code snippets.
Spell commands in lowercase and italicized, regardless of context.
Bold only full sentences or sequences of words that can be read as stand-alone sentences. Do not bold separate words or sequences that don't have a complete meaning on their own.
Ensure all sentences that end with a colon are complete and have a meaning on their own. For example, "To monitor pods within a namespace:" isn't a complete sentence. Make it one, along with all others like " Kubectl will make the Dashboard available at:", etc.
Do not start or end (sub)sections with anything but a regular paragraph, e.g., do not start or end a (sub)section with a code snippet, image, or bulleted list. There are a lot of instances to correct here of (sub)sections both starting and ending in non-paragraphs. Surround each table, code snippet, list, or image with regular paragraphs on both sides.
Do not use the future tense after the first section (remove/rephrase all will/'ll after section 1).
Avoid "our" unless strictly necessary.
Deploying Our Sample Web Application > Deploy Sample Web Application
Italicize names (such as demo-app), filenames, paths, and others in regular paragraphs.
Do not place filenames on top of code snippets. You can state the filename in the sentence that introduces the code snippet or add it as a comment (not recommended) at the top of (within) the code snippet.
Do not place whitespace before punctuation, such as commas, periods, etc. In other words, correct "Server deployment , add".
Do not introduce code snippets with non-content sentences like "Output:".
Include all output of commands within the code snippet that runs the command.
The sentence "Let's Deploy the Dashboard:" should not end with a colon.
allow(s) > enable(s) [unless specifically talking about permissions]
Either briefly summarize the use of Prometheus or omit section 6. Simply referring to another article isn't a good practice. Even when linking to other articles, we do so subtly, on top of the word/concept.
Work in an "In this article" paragraph in section 8.
Reduce the length of section 8.
Remove double spaces everywhere in the regular text and titles.
Do not worry about the word limit.
Ensure all items in the Yoast Readability (not SEO) section are in green. Currently, the "Transition words" ratio is in red.
Thoroughly read and apply the Baeldung guidelines and the checklist on the WordPress editor page.
