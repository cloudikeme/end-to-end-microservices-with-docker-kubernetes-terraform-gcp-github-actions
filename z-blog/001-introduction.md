# **Mastering Microservices: From Development to Deployment**

Welcome to **Mastering Microservices: From Development to Deployment**, a practical tutorial series designed to guide you through the entire process of building, deploying, and managing a microservices-based application. If you're looking to dive deep into microservices architecture and explore the tools and techniques that bring them to life, you're in the right place!

In this series, we’ll build a **conference application** that showcases how microservices can power real-world applications. The app consists of several core services and leverages various databases and a message broker. Each article in this series will focus on a critical aspect of microservices development, helping you go from zero to deploying a production-ready microservices application.

All the code for this tutorial series is available in the official GitHub repository:

### **Overview of the Conference Application**

The conference application is a typical event-management platform that allows users to propose talks (Call for Papers), view the agenda, and receive notifications. Here's an overview of the services and components we'll be building:

#### **Core Services:**
1. **FrontEnd Service**: The web interface for users to interact with the platform.
2. **C4P Service (Call for Papers)**: Manages the submission of talk proposals for the conference.
3. **Agenda Service**: Displays the conference agenda and manages scheduling.
4. **Notifications Service**: Sends notifications about updates, deadlines, or new agenda items.

#### **Databases:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Used for relational data storage, primarily for agenda scheduling and user data.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store used for caching and quick data retrieval.

#### **Message Broker:**
- **Kafka**: Acts as the communication layer between services, enabling event-driven architecture for notifications and agenda updates.

By the end of this series, you’ll have a working conference application running as a set of microservices in production, using state-of-the-art technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and Terraform.

## **What You Will Learn**

In this series, we will start from scratch by setting up the development environment and walk through every phase of microservices development, from creating repositories and writing the code for each service to testing, scaling, and deploying the application. Here's a quick look at what we'll cover:

1. **Setting Up Your Microservice Development Environment**: Learn how to configure your local environment with the essential tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Terraform, and more.
   
2. **Creating Repositories and Writing Microservice Code**: We’ll break down the development process, from initializing Git repositories to writing the code for each service.

3. **Containerization and Packaging with Docker and Ko**: Discover how to containerize your services using Docker and Ko, enabling you to run them in isolated environments.

4. **Service-to-Service Communication**: Learn how to connect your microservices using REST APIs, message brokers like Kafka, and caching with Redis.

5. **Managing Databases and Storage**: We’ll integrate PostgreSQL for relational data and Redis for caching, ensuring data consistency and performance.

6. **Deploying to Kubernetes**: We’ll dive deep into Kubernetes to orchestrate your microservices, managing scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates.

7. **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**: Learn to provision cloud infrastructure using Terraform, ensuring consistency across your environments.

8. **Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions**: Automate your CI/CD pipeline to continuously build, test, and deploy your microservices application.
