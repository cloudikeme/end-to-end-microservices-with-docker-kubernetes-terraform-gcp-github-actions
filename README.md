# end-to-end-microservices-with-docker-kubernetes-terraform-github-actions
In this project, we will be building microservices applications by deploying complex microservices application to production using Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Github Actions and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### Activities
In the course of this project i will be doing the following:

* Create individual microservices
* Package and publish microservices using Docker
* Develop a microservices application on  development computer using Docker Compose
* Test my code, microservices, and application using Jest and Playwright
* Integrate third-party servers into my application (like MongoDB and
* RabbitMQ, as examples)
* Communicate between microservices using HTTP and RabbitMQ messages
* Store the data and files my microservices need to operate
* Deploy my microservices to a production Kubernetes cluster on GCP
* Create production infrastructure using Terraform
* Create a continuous deployment pipeline that automatically deploys my application as i push changes to my code repository on GitHub
