# end-to-end-microservices-with-docker-kubernetes-terraform-github-actions
In this project, we will be building microservices applications by deploying complex microservices application to production using Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Github Actions and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

I will:
Create individual microservices
Package and publish microservices using Docker
Develop a microservices application on  development computer using Docker Compose
Test my code, microservices, and application using Jest and Playwright
Integrate third-party servers into my application (like MongoDB and
RabbitMQ, as examples)
Communicate between microservices using HTTP and RabbitMQ
messages
Store the data and files my microservices need to operate
Deploy my microservices to a production Kubernetes cluster on GCP
Create production infrastructure using Terraform
Create a continuous deployment pipeline that automatically deploys
your application as you push changes to your code repository on GitHub
